# Agile

## What It Is

Agile is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and delivering working software in short cycles. It values responding to change over following a rigid plan, and prioritizes customer collaboration throughout the development process.

## Core Principles (Non-Negotiables)

- **Working software over comprehensive documentation** — Deliver functional increments frequently
- **Responding to change over following a plan** — Embrace requirement changes, even late in development
- **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation** — Continuous stakeholder involvement
- **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools** — Trust the team
- **Iterative delivery** — Ship small, ship often (typically 1-4 week sprints)

## How It Applies to Cambium

### Where We Align

- **Iterative development**: Features ship incrementally (Purchasing v2, Security phases)
- **Working software priority**: Production deploys happen frequently via Railway auto-deploy
- **Responding to change**: Architecture evolves (hexagonal migration in progress)
- **Small batches**: Commits are small and focused (trunk-based development)

### Where We Dont

- **No formal sprints**: No sprint boards, velocity tracking, or ceremonies in repo
- **No backlog artifacts**: No user stories or acceptance criteria documented
- **Solo development**: Team collaboration artifacts not present (single developer context)

### Compliance Desirable?

Partially. The **principles** are valuable and largely followed informally. Formal **ceremonies** (standups, retrospectives) add overhead for solo/small team work. Adopt lightweight agile (kanban-style) rather than full Scrum.
