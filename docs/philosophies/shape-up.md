# Shape Up

## What It Is

Shape Up is Basecamps alternative to agile sprints. It uses 6-week cycles with shaped pitches that define the problem and boundaries but not the solution. Teams have full autonomy within the appetite (time budget), and theres no backlog — ideas must be re-pitched each cycle.

## Core Principles (Non-Negotiables)

- **Appetite over estimates** — Define time budget first, scope to fit
- **Shaping before building** — Senior people define problem boundaries, not solutions
- **6-week cycles** — Long enough for meaningful work, short enough to limit risk
- **Cool-down period** — 2 weeks between cycles for cleanup and exploration
- **No backlog** — Ideas not pitched in current cycle must be re-pitched
- **Hill charts** — Track progress as "figuring out" vs "making it happen"
- **Circuit breaker** — Kill projects that arent working by end of cycle

## How It Applies to Cambium

### Where We Align

- **Appetite thinking**: Features scoped to available time ("fix in this session" vs "full refactor")
- **Problem shaping**: Design specs created before implementation (Purchasing v2 Design Spec)
- **Autonomy**: AI/developer has full autonomy within defined scope

### Where We Dont

- **No formal 6-week cycles**: Work is continuous, not batched
- **No pitches**: No pitch documents or betting table
- **No hill charts**: Progress not tracked in this format
- **No cool-down**: No explicit recovery periods

### Compliance Desirable?

Low priority. Shape Up optimizes for teams of 2-3 working on distinct projects. Current solo + AI context doesnt benefit from the ceremony. The **mindset** (appetite, shaping) is valuable.
